  abstract={Flow matching models have emerged as a powerful method for generative modeling on domains like images or videos, and even on unstructured data like 3D point clouds. These models are commonly trained in two stages: first, a data compressor (i.e., a variational auto-encoder) is trained, and in a subsequent training stage a flow matching generative model is trained in the low-dimensional latent space of the data compressor. This two stage paradigm adds complexity to the overall training recipe and sets obstacles for unifying models across data domains, as specific data compressors are used for different data modalities. To this end, we introduce Ambient Space Flow Transformers (ASFT), a domain-agnostic approach to learn flow matching transformers in ambient space, sidestepping the requirement of training compressors and simplifying the training process. We introduce a conditionally independent point-wise training objective that enables ASFT to make predictions continuously in coordinate space. Our empirical results demonstrate that using general purpose transformer blocks, ASFT effectively handles different data modalities such as images and 3D point clouds, achieving strong performance in both domains and outperforming comparable approaches. ASFT is a promising step towards domain-agnostic flow matching generative models that can be trivially adopted in different data domains.}

  abstract={Diffusion models have become the dominant approach for visual generation. They are trained by denoising a Markovian process that gradually adds noise to the input. We argue that the Markovian property limits the models ability to fully utilize the generation trajectory, leading to inefficiencies during training and inference. In this paper, we propose DART, a transformer-based model that unifies autoregressive (AR) and diffusion within a non-Markovian framework. DART iteratively denoises image patches spatially and spectrally using an AR model with the same architecture as standard language models. DART does not rely on image quantization, enabling more effective image modeling while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, DART seamlessly trains with both text and image data in a unified model. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, offering a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models. Through this unified framework, DART sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-quality image synthesis.}

  abstract={We present a novel way to predict molecular conformers through a simple formulation that sidesteps many of the heuristics of prior works and achieves state of the art results by using the advantages of scale. By training a diffusion generative model directly on 3D atomic positions without making assumptions about the explicit structure of molecules (e.g. modeling torsional angles) we are able to radically simplify structure learning, and make it trivial to scale up the model sizes. This model, called Molecular Conformer Fields (MCF), works by parameterizing conformer structures as functions that map elements from a molecular graph directly to their 3D location in space. This formulation allows us to boil down the essence of structure prediction to learning a distribution over functions. Experimental results show that scaling up the model capacity leads to large gains in generalization performance without enforcing inductive biases like rotational equivariance. MCF represents an advance in extending diffusion models to handle complex scientific problems in a conceptually simple, scalable and effective manner.}

  abstract={Recent advances in equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) have made deep learning amenable to developing fast surrogate models to expensive ab initio quantum mechanics (QM) approaches for molecular potential predictions. However, building accurate and transferable potential models using GNNs remains challenging, as the data is greatly limited by the expensive computational costs and level of theory of QM methods, especially for large and complex molecular systems. In this work, we propose denoise pretraining on nonequilibrium molecular conformations to achieve more accurate and transferable GNN potential predictions. Specifically, atomic coordinates of sampled nonequilibrium conformations are perturbed by random noises and GNNs are pretrained to denoise the perturbed molecular conformations which recovers the original coordinates. Rigorous experiments on multiple benchmarks reveal that pretraining significantly improves the accuracy of neural potentials. Furthermore, we show that the proposed pretraining approach is model-agnostic, as it improves the performance of different invariant and equivariant GNNs. Notably, our models pretrained on small molecules demonstrate remarkable transferability, improving performance when fine-tuned on diverse molecular systems, including different elements, charged molecules, biomolecules, and larger systems. These results highlight the potential for leveraging denoise pretraining approaches to build more generalizable neural potentials for complex molecular systems.}

Due to the non-negligible surface interaction and the effect of discrete solvent molecules, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is often used as an essential tool to study the behavior of ions under nanoconfinement. Despite the accuracy of MD simulation in modeling nanoconfinement systems, it is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose neural network to predict ion concentration profiles in nanochannels with different configurations, including channel widths, ion molarity, and ion types. By modeling the ion concentration profile as a probability distribution, our neural network can serve as a much faster surrogate model for MD simulation with high accuracy. We further demonstrate the superior prediction accuracy of neural network over XGBoost. Lastly, we demonstrated that neural network is flexible in predicting ion concentration profiles with different bin sizes. Overall, our deep learning model is a fast, flexible, and accurate surrogate model to predict ion concentration profiles in nanoconfinement.}

However, such methods have not been investigated in polymer sciences. Herein, we report TransPolymer, a Transformer-based language model for polymer property prediction. Our proposed polymer tokenizer with chemical awareness enables learning representations from polymer sequences. Rigorous experiments on ten polymer property prediction benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of TransPolymer. Moreover, we show that TransPolymer benefits from pretraining on large unlabeled dataset via Masked Language Modeling. Experimental results further manifest the important role of self-attention in modeling polymer sequences. We highlight this model as a promising computational tool for promoting rational polymer design and understanding structure-property relationships from a data science view.}

  abstract = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are materials with a high degree of porosity that can be used for many applications. However, the chemical space of MOFs is enormous due to the large variety of possible combinations of building blocks and topology. Discovering the optimal MOFs for specific applications requires an efficient and accurate search over countless potential candidates. Previous high-throughput screening methods using computational simulations like DFT can be time-consuming. Such methods also require the 3D atomic structures of MOFs, which adds one extra step when evaluating hypothetical MOFs. In this work, we propose a structure-agnostic deep learning method based on the Transformer model, named as MOFormer, for property predictions of MOFs. MOFormer takes a text string representation of MOF (MOFid) as input, thus circumventing the need of obtaining the 3D structure of a hypothetical MOF and accelerating the screening process. By comparing to other descriptors such as Stoichiometric-120 and revised autocorrelations, we demonstrate that MOFormer can achieve state-of-the-art structure-agnostic prediction accuracy on all benchmarks. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework that pretrains the MOFormer via maximizing the cross-correlation between its structure-agnostic representations and structure-based representations of the crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) on >400k publicly available MOF data. Benchmarks show that pretraining improves the prediction accuracy of both models on various downstream prediction tasks. Furthermore, we revealed that MOFormer can be more data-efficient on quantum-chemical property prediction than structure-based CGCNN when training data is limited. Overall, MOFormer provides a novel perspective on efficient MOF property prediction using deep learning.}

  abstract={Ionic Liquids (ILs) provide a promising solution for CO2 capture and storage to mitigate global warming. However, identifying and designing the high-capacity IL from the giant chemical space requires expensive, and exhaustive simulations and experiments. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate the process of searching for desirable ionic molecules through accurate and efficient property predictions in a data-driven manner. But existing descriptors and ML models for the ionic molecule suffer from the inefficient adaptation of molecular graph structure. Besides, few works have investigated the explainability of ML models to help understand the learned features that can guide the design of efficient ionic molecules. In this work, we develop both fingerprint-based ML models and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict the CO2 absorption in ILs. Fingerprint works on graph structure at the feature extraction stage, while GNNs directly handle molecule structure in both the feature extraction and model prediction stage. We show that our method outperforms previous ML models by reaching a high accuracy (MAE of 0.0137, R2 of 0.9884). Furthermore, we take the advantage of GNNs feature representation and develop a substructure-based explanation method that provides insight into how each chemical fragments within IL molecules contribute to the CO2 absorption prediction of ML models. We also show that our explanation result agrees with some ground truth from the theoretical reaction mechanism of CO2 absorption in ILs, which can advise on the design of novel and efficient functional ILs in the future.}

  abstract={Deep learning has been a prevalence in computational chemistry and widely implemented in molecule property predictions. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL), especially contrastive learning (CL), gathers growing attention for the potential to learn molecular representations that generalize to the gigantic chemical space. Unlike supervised learning, SSL can directly leverage large unlabeled data, which greatly reduces the effort to acquire molecular property labels through costly and time-consuming simulations or experiments. However, most molecular SSL methods borrow the insights from the machine learning community but neglect the unique cheminformatics (e.g., molecular fingerprints) and multi-level graphical structures (e.g., functional groups) of molecules. In this work, we propose iMolCLR: improvement of Molecular Contrastive Learning of Representations with graph neural networks (GNNs) in two aspects, (1) mitigating faulty negative contrastive instances via considering cheminformatics similarities between molecule pairs; (2) fragment-level contrasting between intra- and inter-molecule substructures decomposed from molecules. Experiments have shown that the proposed strategies significantly improve the performance of GNN models on various challenging molecular property predictions. In comparison to the previous CL framework, iMolCLR demonstrates an averaged 1.2% improvement of ROC-AUC on 8 classification benchmarks and an averaged 10.1% decrease of the error on 6 regression benchmarks. On most benchmarks, the generic GNN pre-trained by iMolCLR rivals or even surpasses supervised learning models with sophisticated architecture designs and engineered features. Further investigations demonstrate that representations learned through iMolCLR intrinsically embed scaffolds and functional groups that can reason molecule similarities.}

A contrastive estimator maximizes the agreement of augmentations from the same molecule while minimizing the agreement of different molecules. Experiments show that our contrastive learning framework significantly improves the performance of graph-neural-network encoders on various molecular property benchmarks including both classification and regression tasks.

To modulate the GPCR activity with highly specific drugs and minimal side-effects, it is necessary to quantitatively describe the important structural features in the GPCR and correlate them to the activation state of GPCR. In this study, we developed 3 ML approaches to predict the conformation state of GPCR proteins. Additionally, we predict the activity level of GPCRs based on their structure. We leverage the unique advantages of each of the 3 ML approach, interpretability of XGBoost, minimal feature engineering for 3D convolutional neural network, and graph representation of protein structure for graph neural network. By using these ML approaches, we are able to predict the GPCRs activation state with high accuracy (91\%-95\%) and also predict the activation state of GPCRs with low error (MAE of 7.15-10.58). Furthermore, the interpretation of the ML approaches allow us to determine the importance of each of the features in distinguishing between the GPCRs conformations.}

The DRL agent iteratively changes the positions of atoms in the near-surface region to generate kinetic pathways to accessible local minima involving changes in the surface compositions. We showcase our agent by predicting the surface reconstruction pathways of a ternary Ni3Pd3Au2(111) alloy catalyst. Our results show that the DRL agent can not only explore more diverse surface compositions than the conventional minima hopping method, but also generate the kinetic surface reconstruction pathways. We further demonstrate that the kinetic pathway to a global minimum energy surface composition and its associated transition state predicted by our agent is in good agreement with the minimum energy path predicted by nudged elastic band calculations.}

Structure and topology of nanopores on such materials can be important for their performances in real-world engineering applications, like water desalination. However, discovering the most efficient nanopores often involves a very large number of experiments or simulations that are expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we propose a data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) framework for discovering the most efficient graphene nanopore for water desalination. Via a combination of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and convolutional neural network (CNN), we are able to rapidly create and screen thousands of graphene nanopores and select the most energy-efficient ones. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on promising AI-created graphene nanopores show that they have higher water flux while maintaining rival ion rejection rate compared to the normal circular nanopores. Irregular shape with rough edges geometry of AI-created pores is found to be the key factor for their high water desalination performance. Ultimately, this study shows that AI can be a powerful tool for nanomaterial design and screening.}

In such light, we propose a sound Adversarially Robust Imitation Learning (ARIL) method. In our setting, an agent and an adversary are trained alternatively. The former with adversarially attacked input at each timestep mimics the behavior of an online expert and the latter learns to add perturbations on the states by forcing the learned agent to fail on choosing the right decisions. We theoretically prove that ARIL can achieve adversarial robustness and evaluate ARIL on multiple benchmarks from DM Control Suite. The result reveals that our method (ARIL) achieves better robustness compare with other imitation learning methods under both sensory attack and physical attack.}
